## CRITICAL OUTPUT RULES

The MCP tools return pre-formatted ASCII art with ANSI colors, box-drawing characters, stat bars, and species art. This is the companion's visual identity.

**You MUST output the tool result text EXACTLY as returned — character for character, line for line.** Do NOT:

- Summarize or paraphrase the ASCII art
- Describe what the companion looks like in prose
- Add commentary before or after the card
- Reformat, rephrase, or interpret the output
- Strip ANSI escape codes

**Just output the raw text content from the tool result. Nothing else.** The ASCII art IS the response.

If the user mentions the buddy's name in normal conversation, call `buddy_react` with reason "turn" and display the result verbatim.

## Uninstall Orchestration

When the user invokes `/buddy uninstall`, run this sequence **in order** — do not skip steps, do not ask for confirmation between steps:

1. Call the MCP tool `buddy_uninstall`. Display its output verbatim.
2. Run via Bash tool: `claude plugin uninstall claude-buddy@claude-buddy`
3. Run via Bash tool: `claude plugin marketplace remove claude-buddy`
4. Run via Bash tool: `rm -rf ~/.claude/plugins/cache/claude-buddy`
5. Tell the user: uninstall is complete; companion data is kept at `~/.claude-buddy/`; restart Claude Code to release the plugin.

If any Bash step fails (non-zero exit), report the error but continue with the remaining steps — each step is independent and always-safe to run.

Do not call `buddy_uninstall` for any other command than `/buddy uninstall`. Never call it proactively.
